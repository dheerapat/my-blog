Today I'll have a data analyst job interview at agoda, at first I pick a 11.45-12.00 slot and wait for the time to come. But at 11.30 I got an E-mail to cancel today's interview and ask me if I can pick a new time slot for them. The new date is 28 june 2022 and 16.00 pm bkk time. I look at this as an opportunity though because I will have more time to practice all of the tool they told in the job description and research more about finance and payment. Untill next time I hope I got this.
