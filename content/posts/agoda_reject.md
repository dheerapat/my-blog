As expected, after brief 10 minutes interview. They ask me to wait for a few days for them to discuss about me. and i have a feeling that I may not make it through. And finally they e-mailed me with a letter to reject my application. But overall I think I've make a good start and have a good feeling in the next job interview.  

And I already sent a ton of job application across the data industry! ha ha!
