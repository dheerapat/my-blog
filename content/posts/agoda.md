I will have my first tech-company job interview tomorrow. The role I applied is financed data analyst. Sure enough I pretty comfortable about analyst part but in a finance part is another story. I done a quick Excel and SQL exercise to refresh my memory and re-read job description a dozen of time to wrap up my mind around it.

After 2 year of "boring but chill" job, I finally took a step forward to a tech path. In reality my ultimate goal is not a data analyst but to be a freelance software developer and travel the world while making money on the fly. But to archive that goal I have to first dip my toe into this industry.

That's it for today, I'll keep you update about how the interview go. Hope it come out good!
